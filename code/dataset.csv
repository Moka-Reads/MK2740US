The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” — Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” — Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” — Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” — John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” — Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” — Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” — Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” — Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” — Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.

This textbook provides a first course in stochastic programming suitable for students with a basic knowledge of linear programming, elementary analysis, and probability. The authors present a broad overview of the main themes and methods of the subject, thus helping students develop an intuition for how to model uncertainty into mathematical problems, what uncertainty changes bring to the decision process, and what techniques help to manage uncertainty in solving the problems. The early chapters introduce some worked examples of stochastic programming, demonstrate how a stochastic model is formally built, develop the properties of stochastic programs and the basic solution techniques used to solve them. The book then goes on to cover approximation and sampling techniques and is rounded off by an in-depth case study. A well-paced and wide-ranging introduction to this subject.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780387226187'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0387226184'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 427, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Mathematics'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '1.2.1.0.preview.1', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jRfnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jRfnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=jRfnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=18&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jRfnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jRfnBwAAQBAJ'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 124.39, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 99.51, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jRfnBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jRfnBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 124390000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 99510000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}, {'finskyOfferType': 3, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 43540000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 39190000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'rentalDuration': {'unit': 'DAY', 'count': 90}}]}",99.51

This book builds a bridge between the recreational world of algorithmic puzzles (puzzles that can be solved by algorithms) and the pragmatic world of computer programming, teaching readers to program while solving puzzles. Few introductory students want to program for programming's sake. Puzzles are real-world applications that are attention grabbing, intriguing, and easy to describe. Each lesson starts with the description of a puzzle. After a failed attempt or two at solving the puzzle, the reader arrives at an Aha! moment—a search strategy, data structure, or mathematical fact—and the solution presents itself. The solution to the puzzle becomes the specification of the code to be written. Readers will thus know what the code is supposed to do before seeing the code itself. This represents a pedagogical philosophy that decouples understanding the functionality of the code from understanding programming language syntax and semantics. Python syntax and semantics required to understand the code are explained as needed for each puzzle. Readers need only the rudimentary grasp of programming concepts that can be obtained from introductory or AP computer science classes in high school. The book includes more than twenty puzzles and more than seventy programming exercises that vary in difficulty. Many of the puzzles are well known and have appeared in publications and on websites in many variations. They range from scheduling selfie time with celebrities to solving Sudoku problems in seconds to verifying the six degrees of separation hypothesis. The code for selected puzzle solutions is downloadable from the book's website; the code for all puzzle solutions is available to instructors."", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262343190'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262343193'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 273, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Computers'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.4.6.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SJg-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SJg-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=SJg-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=42&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SJg-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SJg-DwAAQBAJ'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 33.99, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 33.99, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SJg-DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SJg-DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 33990000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 33990000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}]}",33.99

In such a problem, the goal is to find a solution among a large but finite number of possibilities. The idea of ASP came from research on artificial intelligence and computational logic. ASP is a form of declarative programming: an ASP program describes what is counted as a solution to the problem, but does not specify an algorithm for solving it. Search is performed by sophisticated software systems called answer set solvers. Combinatorial search problems often arise in science and technology, and ASP has found applications in diverse areas—in historical linguistic, in bioinformatics, in robotics, in space exploration, in oil and gas industry, and many others. The importance of this programming method was recognized by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 2016, when AI Magazine published a special issue on answer set programming. The book introduces the reader to the theory and practice of ASP. It describes the input language of the answer set solver CLINGO, which was designed at the University of Potsdam in Germany and is used today by ASP programmers in many countries. It includes numerous examples of ASP programs and present the mathematical theory that ASP is based on.

Leaving source code open has generated some of the most sophisticated developments in computer technology, including, most notably, Linux and Apache, which pose a significant challenge to Microsoft in the marketplace. As Steven Weber discusses, open source\'s success in a highly competitive industry has subverted many assumptions about how businesses are run, and how intellectual products are created and protected. Traditionally, intellectual property law has allowed companies to control knowledge and has guarded the rights of the innovator, at the expense of industry-wide cooperation. In turn, engineers of new software code are richly rewarded; but, as Weber shows, in spite of the conventional wisdom that innovation is driven by the promise of individual and corporate wealth, ensuring the free distribution of code among computer programmers can empower a more effective process for building intellectual products. In the case of Open Source, independent programmers--sometimes hundreds or thousands of them--make unpaid contributions to software that develops organically, through trial and error. Weber argues that the success of open source is not a freakish exception to economic principles. The open source community is guided by standards, rules, decisionmaking procedures, and sanctioning mechanisms. Weber explains the political and economic dynamics of this mysterious but important market development. Table of Contents: Preface 1. Property and the Problem of Software 2. The Early History of Open Source 3. What Is Open Source and How Does It Work? 4. A Maturing Model of Production 5. Explaining Open Source: Microfoundations 6. Explaining Open Source: Macro-Organization 7. Business Models and the Law 8. The Code That Changed the World? Notes Index Reviews of this book: In the world of open-source software, true believers can be a fervent bunch. Linux, for example, may act as a credo as well as an operating system. But there is much substance beyond zealotry, says Steven Weber, the author of The Success of Open Source...An open-source operating system offers its source code up to be played with, extended, debugged, and otherwise tweaked in an orgy of user collaboration. The author traces the roots of that ethos and process in the early years of computers...He also analyzes the interface between open source and the worlds of business and law, as well as wider issues in the clash between hierarchical structures and networks, a subject with relevance beyond the software industry to the war on terrorism. --Nina C. Ayoub, Chronicle of Higher Education Reviews of this book: A valuable new account of the [open-source software] movement. --Edward Rothstein, New York Times We can blindly continue to develop, reward, protect, and organize around knowledge assets on the comfortable assumption that their traditional property rights remain inviolate. Or we can listen to Steven Weber and begin to make our peace with the uncomfortable fact that the very foundations of our familiar ""knowledge as property"" world have irrevocably shifted. --Alan Kantrow, Chief Knowledge Officer, Monitor Group Ever since the invention of agriculture, human beings have had only three social-engineering tools for organizing any large-scale division of labor: markets (and the carrots of material benefits they offer), hierarchies (and the sticks of punishment they impose), and charisma (and the promises of rapture they offer). Now there is the possibility of a fourth mode of effective social organization--one that we perhaps see in embryo in the creation and maintenance of open-source software. My Berkeley colleague Steven Weber\'s book is a brilliant exploration of this fascinating topic. --J. Bradford DeLong, Department of Economics, University of California at Berkeley Steven Weber has produced a significant, insightful book that is both smart and important. The most impressive achievement of this volume is that Weber has spent the time to learn and think about the technological, sociological, business, and legal perspectives related to open source. The Success of Open Source is timely and more thought provoking than almost anything I\'ve come across in the past several years.

Designed to provide practical, instantly useful techniques for working developers, this clearly written tutorial introduces you to using type systems to support everyday programming tasks. About the technology Common bugs often result from mismatched data types. By precisely naming and controlling which data are allowable in a calculation, a strong type system can eliminate whole classes of errors and ensure data integrity throughout an application. As a developer, skillfully using types in your everyday practice leads to better code and saves time tracking down tricky data-related errors. About the book Programming with Types teaches type-based techniques for writing software that’s safe, correct, easy to maintain, and practically self-documenting. Designed for working developers, this clearly written tutorial sticks with the practical benefits of type systems for everyday programming tasks. Following real-world examples coded in TypeScript, you’ll build your skills from primitive types up to more-advanced concepts like functors and monads. What's inside Building data structures with primitive types, arrays, and references How types affect functions, inheritance, and composition Object-oriented programming with types Applying generics and higher-kinded types About the reader You’ll need experience with a mainstream programming language like TypeScript, Java, JavaScript, C#, or C++.

Although the details of biological evolution are not completely understood (even nowadays), there exist some points supported by strong experimental evidence: • Evolution is a process operating over chromosomes rather than over organisms. The former are organic tools encoding the structure of a living being, i.e., a cr- ture is “built” decoding a set of chromosomes. • Natural selection is the mechanism that relates chromosomes with the ef ciency of the entity they represent, thus allowing that ef cient organism which is we- adapted to the environment to reproduce more often than those which are not. • The evolutionary process takes place during the reproduction stage. There exists a large number of reproductive mechanisms in Nature. Most common ones are mutation (that causes the chromosomes of offspring to be different to those of the parents) and recombination (that combines the chromosomes of the parents to produce the offspring). Based upon the features above, the three mentioned models of evolutionary c- puting were independently (and almost simultaneously) developed.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783540731900'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3540731903'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 453, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Technology & Engineering'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '4.8.2.0.preview.1', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wonrLjj2GagC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wonrLjj2GagC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=wonrLjj2GagC&pg=PA156&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=112&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wonrLjj2GagC&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wonrLjj2GagC'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 233.24, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 186.59, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wonrLjj2GagC&rdid=book-wonrLjj2GagC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 233240000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 186590000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}, {'finskyOfferType': 3, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 81640000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 73480000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'rentalDuration': {'unit': 'DAY', 'count': 90}}]}",186.59

This approach will give you a solid foundation for writing useful, correct, maintainable, and efficient code. Programming with Today’s C++ (C++11 and C++14) The book is an introduction to programming in general, including object-oriented programming and generic programming. It is also a solid introduction to the C++ programming language, one of the most widely used languages for real-world software. The book presents modern C++ programming techniques from the start, introducing the C++ standard library and C++11 and C++14 features to simplify programming tasks. For Beginners—And Anyone Who Wants to Learn Something New The book is primarily designed for people who have never programmed before, and it has been tested with many thousands of first-year university students. It has also been extensively used for self-study. Also, practitioners and advanced students have gained new insight and guidance by seeing how a master approaches the elements of his art. Provides a Broad View The first half of the book covers a wide range of essential concepts, design and programming techniques, language features, and libraries. Those will enable you to write programs involving input, output, computation, and simple graphics.

The Conference Co-Chairs Associate Professor Sarah Jane Johnston and Associate Professor Shawren Singh both from University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa. ECEL is now a well-established event on the academic research calendar and now in its 22nd year the key aim remains the opportunity for participants to share ideas and meet the people who hold them. The scope of papers will ensure an interesting two days. The subjects covered illustrate the wide range of topics that fall into this important and ever-growing area of research. It is especially relevant that the conference is being hosted by UNISA this year as the university celebrates its 150th anniversary. UNISA has been a pioneer in first distance and now e-Learning. The conference will also host the final round of the 9th e-Learning Excellence Awards where innovate case histories will be presented. The opening keynote presentation is given by Professor Thenjiwe Meyiwa, Vice Principal for the Research, Postgraduate Studies, Innovation and Commercialisation at University of South Africa who will speak on, “The Role of African Feminisms in Shaping a Sustainable Future of Being and Learning”. An afternoon keynote on Thursday will be made by Dr Zolile Martin Mguda, University of South Africa on the topic of “ChatGPT: The first year”. The second day of the conference will open with an address by Dr Isabel Tarling, MD, Limina, South Africa with the title “Developing Digital Standards for Learning and Teaching in South Africa’s Schools”.

Presenting the distinguished and exemplary works by educators and researchers in the field highlighting the contemporary trends and issues, creative and unique approaches, innovative methods, frameworks, pedagogies and theoretical and practical aspects in computational thinking. A decade ago the notion of computational thinking was introduced by Jeannette Wing and envisioned that computational thinking will be a fundamental skill that complements to reading, writing and arithmetic for everyone and represents a universally applicable attitude. The computational thinking is considered a thought processes involved in a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour. Assimilating computational thinking at young age will assist them to enhance problem solving skills, improve logical reasoning, and advance analytical ability - key attributes to succeed in the 21st century. Educators around the world are investing their relentless effort in equipping the young generation with real-world skills ready for the demand and challenges of the future. It is commonly believed that computational thinking will play a pivotal and dominant role in this endeavour.

This book takes the author’s experience of taking on a project that required functional programming and real-time systems, breaks it down, and organizes it. You will get the necessary knowledge about differences to the languages you know, where to start, and where to go next. Have you been told by your customer or manager that they heard good things about Erlang, you should use it for the next project? Never had to deal with functional programming or real-time systems? In 2014, the author, Wolfgang Loder, developed a repository for digital assets that had to deliver those assets in binary form quickly and reliably, being able to deal with at least hundreds of requests per second. Since he could decide the architecture and software stack of the solution, he immediately thought of Erlang and its libraries and started to evaluate this option. It was not long after that he discovered Elixir, which sits on top of the Erlang virtual machine and has features more palatable for non-functional programmers, although it is a functional programming language itself. Erlang and Elixir for Imperative Programmers gives you a basis for deciding whether the effort is viable for your next project.

Martin'], 'publisher': 'Pearson Education', 'publishedDate': '2008-08-01', 'description': 'Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780136083252'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0136083250'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 464, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Computers'], 'averageRating': 5, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '3.23.15.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&pg=PP1&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=209&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 59.99, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 47.39, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&rdid=book-_i6bDeoCQzsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 59990000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 47390000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}]}",47.39

Now, two of the world\'s most respected C++ experts distill the rich collective experience of the global C++ community into a set of coding standards that every developer and development team can understand and use as a basis for their own coding standards. The authors cover virtually every facet of C++ programming: design and coding style, functions, operators, class design, inheritance, construction/destruction, copying, assignment, namespaces, modules, templates, genericity, exceptions, STL containers and algorithms, and more. Each standard is described concisely, with practical examples. From type definition to error handling, this book presents C++ best practices, including some that have only recently been identified and standardized-techniques you may not know even if you\'ve used C++ for years. Along the way, you\'ll find answers to questions like What\'s worth standardizing--and what isn\'t? What are the best ways to code for scalability? What are the elements of a rational error handling policy? How (and why) do you avoid unnecessary initialization, cyclic, and definitional dependencies? When (and how) should you use static and dynamic polymorphism together? How do you practice ""safe"" overriding? When should you provide a no-fail swap? Why and how should you prevent exceptions from propagating across module boundaries? Why shouldn\'t you write namespace declarations or directives in a header file? Why should you use STL vector and string instead of arrays? How do you choose the right STL search or sort algorithm? What rules should you follow to ensure type-safe code? Whether you\'re working alone or with others, C++ Coding Standards will help you write cleaner code--and write it faster, with fewer hassles and less frustration.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780132654425'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0132654423'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 489, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Computers'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '1.13.11.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=228&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mmjVIC6WolgC'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 72.49, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 57.99, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mmjVIC6WolgC&rdid=book-mmjVIC6WolgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 72490000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 57990000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}]}",57.99

Craftsmanship has its quiet rewards, the satisfaction that comes from building a useful object and making it work. Excitement arrives with the flash of insight that cracks a previously intractable problem. The spiritual quest for elegance can turn the hacker into an artist. There are pleasures in parsimony, in squeezing the last drop of performance out of clever algorithms and tight coding. The games, puzzles, and challenges of problems from international programming competitions are a great way to experience these pleasures while improving your algorithmic and coding skills. This book contains over 100 problems that have appeared in previous programming contests, along with discussions of the theory and ideas necessary to attack them. Instant online grading for all of these problems is available from two WWW robot judging sites. Combining this book with a judge gives an exciting new way to challenge and improve your programming skills. This book can be used for self-study, for teaching innovative courses in algorithms and programming, and in training for international competition. The problems in this book have been selected from over 1,000 programming problems at the Universidad de Valladolid online judge.

But, unreasonable deadlines and shortcuts make it very hard to create such an architecture. Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture starts with a discussion about the conventional layered architecture style and its disadvantages. It also talks about the advantages of the domain-centric architecture styles of Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture and Alistair Cockburn's Hexagonal Architecture. Then, the book dives into hands-on chapters that show you how to manifest a hexagonal architecture in actual code. You'll learn in detail about different mapping strategies between the layers of a hexagonal architecture and see how to assemble the architecture elements into an application. The later chapters demonstrate how to enforce architecture boundaries. You'll also learn what shortcuts produce what types of technical debt and how, sometimes, it is a good idea to willingly take on those debts. After reading this book, you'll have all the knowledge you need to create applications using the hexagonal architecture style of web development. What you will learnIdentify potential shortcomings of using a layered architectureApply methods to enforce architecture boundariesFind out how potential shortcuts can affect the software architectureProduce arguments for when to use which style of architectureStructure your code according to the architectureApply various types of tests that will cover each element of the architectureWho this book is for This book is for you if you care about the architecture of the software you are building. To get the most out of this book, you must have some experience with web development. The code examples in this book are in Java.

However, Perl incorporates many features that have their roots in other languages such as Lisp. These advanced features are not well understood and are rarely used by most Perl programmers, but they are very powerful. They can automate tasks in everyday programming that are difficult to solve in any other way. One of the most powerful of these techniques is writing functions that manufacture or modify other functions. For example, instead of writing ten similar functions, a programmer can write a general pattern or framework that can then create the functions as needed according to the pattern. For several years Mark Jason Dominus has worked to apply functional programming techniques to Perl. Now Mark brings these flexible programming methods that he has successfully taught in numerous tutorials and training sessions to a wider audience.* Introduces powerful programming methodsnew to most Perl programmersthat were previously the domain of computer scientists* Gradually builds up confidence by describing techniques of progressive sophistication* Shows how to improve everyday programs and includes numerous engaging code examples to illustrate the methods', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780080478340'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0080478344'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 601, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Computers'], 'averageRating': 5, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'contentVersion': '1.9.8.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=264&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 91, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 69.16, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4_q8JJWNaTsC&rdid=book-4_q8JJWNaTsC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 91000000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 69160000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}, {'finskyOfferType': 3, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 36400000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 32760000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'rentalDuration': {'unit': 'DAY', 'count': 90}}]}",69.16

When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually!

Vaughn Vernon couples guided approaches to implementation with modern architectures, highlighting the importance and value of focusing on the business domain while balancing technical considerations. Building on Eric Evans’ seminal book, Domain-Driven Design, the author presents practical DDD techniques through examples from familiar domains. Each principle is backed up by realistic Java examples–all applicable to C# developers–and all content is tied together by a single case study: the delivery of a large-scale Scrum-based SaaS system for a multitenant environment. The author takes you far beyond “DDD-lite” approaches that embrace DDD solely as a technical toolset, and shows you how to fully leverage DDD’s “strategic design patterns” using Bounded Context, Context Maps, and the Ubiquitous Language. Using these techniques and examples, you can reduce time to market and improve quality, as you build software that is more flexible, more scalable, and more tightly aligned to business goals.

The unique insight of this longtime best seller is that the major issues of software development are human, not technical. They’re not easy issues; but solve them, and you’ll maximize your chances of success. “Peopleware has long been one of my two favorite books on software engineering. Its underlying strength is its base of immense real experience, much of it quantified. Many, many varied projects have been reflected on and distilled; but what we are given is not just lifeless distillate, but vivid examples from which we share the authors’ inductions. Their premise is right: most software project problems are sociological, not technological. The insights on team jelling and work environment have changed my thinking and teaching. The third edition adds strength to strength.” — Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., Kenan Professor of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Author of The Mythical Man-Month and The Design of Design “Peopleware is the one book that everyone who runs a software team needs to read and reread once a year. In the quarter century since the first edition appeared, it has become more important, not less, to think about the social and human issues in software develop¿ment. This is the only way we’re going to make more humane, productive workplaces. Buy it, read it, and keep a stock on hand in the office supply closet.” —Joel Spolsky, Co-founder, Stack Overflow “When a book about a field as volatile as software design and use extends to a third edition, you can be sure that the authors write of deep principle, of the fundamental causes for what we readers experience, and not of the surface that everyone recognizes. And to bring people, actual human beings, into the mix! How excellent. How rare. The authors have made this third edition, with its additions, entirely terrific.” —Lee Devin and Rob Austin, Co-authors of The Soul of Design and Artful Making For this third edition, the authors have added six new chapters and updated the text throughout, bringing it in line with today’s development environments and challenges. For example, the book now discusses pathologies of leadership that hadn’t previously been judged to be pathological; an evolving culture of meetings; hybrid teams made up of people from seemingly incompatible generations; and a growing awareness that some of our most common tools are more like anchors than propellers.

By the end of this book, you will be able to write and read assembly code, mix assembly with higher level languages, know what AVX is, and a lot more than that. The code used in Beginning x64 Assembly Programming is kept as simple as possible, which means: no graphical user interfaces or whistles and bells or error checking. Adding all these nice features would distract your attention from the purpose: learning assembly language. The theory is limited to a strict minimum: a little bit on binary numbers, a short presentation of logical operators, and some limited linear algebra. And we stay far away from doing floating point conversions. The assembly code is presented in complete programs, so that you can test them on your computer, play with them, change them, break them. This book will also show you what tools can beused, how to use them, and the potential problems in those tools. It is not the intention to give you a comprehensive course on all of the assembly instructions, which is impossible in one book: look at the size of the Intel Manuals. Instead, the author will give you a taste of the main items, so that you will have an idea about what is going on. If you work through this book, you will acquire the knowledge to investigate certain domains more in detail on your own. The majority of the book is dedicated to assembly on Linux, because it is the easiest platform to learn assembly language. At the end the author provides a number of chapters to get you on your way with assembly on Windows. You will see that once you have Linux assembly under your belt, it is much easier to take on Windows assembly. This book should not be the first book you read on programming, if you have never programmed before, put this book aside for a while and learn some basics of programming with a higher-level language such as C. What You Will Learn Discover how a CPU and memory works Appreciate how a computer and operating system work together See how high-level language compilers generate machine language, and use that knowledge to write more efficient code Be better equipped to analyze bugs in your programs Get your program working, which is the fun part Investigate malware and take the necessary actions and precautions Who This Book Is For Programmers in high level languages. It is also for systems engineers and security engineers working for malware investigators. Required knowledge: Linux, Windows, virtualization, and higher level programming languages (preferably C or C++).', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781484250761'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1484250761'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 407, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Computers'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'allowAnonLogging': True, 'contentVersion': '0.2.2.0.preview.3', 'panelizationSummary': {'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}, 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mSa7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mSa7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'language': 'en', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.ca/books?id=mSa7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=320&source=gbs_api', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSa7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api', 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSa7DwAAQBAJ'}","{'country': 'CA', 'saleability': 'FOR_SALE', 'isEbook': True, 'listPrice': {'amount': 68.3, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amount': 54.64, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'buyLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSa7DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mSa7DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api', 'offers': [{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 68300000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 54640000, 'currencyCode': 'CAD'}, 'giftable': True}]}",54.64
