  abstract = {We present a trust region-based method for the general nonlinearly equality constrained optimization problem. The method works by iteratively minimizing a quadratic model of the Lagrangian subject to a possibly relaxed linearization of the problem constraints and a trust region constraint. The model minimization may be done approximately with a dogleg-type approach. We show that this method is globally convergent even if singular or indefinite Hessian approximations are made.},
